Forked to adapt for building on Debian:

* Removed `dist.ini` because the build process failed due to an incompatibility
  with the RJBS bundle
* Added `makefile` based build files from the `cpan` module, which were
  themselves autogenerated by Dist::Zilla
* Renamed resulting package from default `libapp-uni-perl` to `uni` as that is
  the debian convention for modules in the `App::` hierarchy
